#+title: Console game of life --- WITH RUST
#+author: Tom√°s Maraschio

** Description
  I made this project as a way to learn rust, it is a copy of my other project https://github.com/tomimara52/console-game-of-life

** Compilation
  =cargo build --release=

** Usage
  =./target/release/rust-game-of-life= or =cargo run=

  Then you can add or remove cells interactively.

*** Controls
**** Editing mode
  When the program first starts you are in editing mode. You can use =wasd= to
move the cursor and press =SPACE= to switch the state of the current cell.
To start the simulation press =q=.

**** Run mode
  Here you can press =p= to pause the game and then press =n= to advance the
simulation one step at a time. Press =q= at any time to exit the program.
