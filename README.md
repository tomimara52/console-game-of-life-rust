## Description
  I made this project as a way to learn rust, it is a copy of my other project: [console-game-of-life](https://github.com/tomimara52/console-game-of-life).

## Compilation
  `cargo build --release`

## Usage
### From file
  `cargo run <filename>`

  Note that you don't have to put the whole filepath, only the filename of the file in `game-files/` directory.
  
### From zero
  `./target/release/rust-game-of-life` or `cargo run`

  Then you can add or remove cells interactively.
